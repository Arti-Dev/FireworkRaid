# Firework Raids
Basic gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikxRdHB-CxY

WIP minigame
- the whole gist is that you're fighting the raiders with fireworks.
  - villagers shoot fireworks after winning a raid, so why not put those fireworks to good use?
- the fireworks are lined up in a queue and you can only use them in the order you're given
  - you restock on items whenever you reach a combo of 7 or when the next wave starts
- racking up a combo and hitting multiple enemies at once lets you score more points (on the scoreboard)
- the heart particles are an indicator for where your firework will explode
- the raiders are glowing so you can actually see where they spawned

what i want to do with this later:
- i might allow more freedom with the queue system, this was really only an excuse to implement a queue-based structure
- im gonna replace the hearts with a display entity that changes color like an actual crosshair
- there could be more items, more fireworks, maybe some mobility items like instaboom & potions
- i might add more raid groups per wave and more mobs to ramp up difficulty
- i might make it so that villagers deposit their fireworks into a chest next to the bell, so you can restock by pulling fireworks out of the chest
- multiplayer support
